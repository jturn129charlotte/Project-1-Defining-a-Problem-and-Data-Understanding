# Project 1: Student Stress Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of the **Student Stress Monitoring Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The goal of this project is to explore how lifestyle, academic, and social factors impact student stress levels.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Stress Monitoring Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets?resource=download)  
- Size: 1100 rows × 21 columns  
- Target variable: `stress_level` (0 = Low, 1 = Medium, 2 = High)  

## 🛠️ Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Bar plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to understand relationships  
- Insights about sleep, study load, academic performance, and social support  

## 📈 Key Findings
- Students with heavier study loads report higher stress.  
- Poor sleep quality is linked with higher stress levels.  
- Higher academic performance and stronger social support appear to buffer stress.  

## 🚀 Impact
This analysis suggests that workload management, sleep hygiene, and peer support could be effective strategies for reducing stress among students.
